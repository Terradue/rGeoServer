This is the main entrance to post a raster on a GeoServer.

  
### Example
  
```coffee
library(rGeoServer)

setwd("~/Downloads")

filename <- "italy.tif"
workspace.name <- "my.workspace"
access.point <- "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/rest"
coverage.store <- "my.coverage"
raster <- raster(filename)

ret <- POSTraster(access.point, workspace, coverage.store, raster)

```
